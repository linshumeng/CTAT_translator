in general
	F- tab doesn't work throughout Optional solving steps or Summary
	F- have to click in next cell in order for grading to occur
	- is there a random order to the combo box options? seems like the denominator answer is always the third option

problem 2
	- hint for Summarize area seems too basic
	- maybe add a top level hint for what the student is supposed to do in that step

problem 3
	*- problem text says "high about Oklahoma" and should be "high above Oklahoma"    
	- do we want to give the student a bottom out hint in the Summarize area for percentage?

problem 4
	F- "cross multiplication" doesn't fit in the combo box
	*- Summarize area gives answer to third part "50 senior pictures"

problem 5
	*- problem text says "If he reads 72 pages on weekend" and it should be "If he reads 72 pages on the weekend"
	
problem 6
	*- problem text should be "If one story accounts [for] 15 minutes of one program"
	*- change combo box options to be in terms of stories

problem 7
	- what percent of the order was she credited?
	C- does not accept .12, only accepts 0.12 for numerator
	C- does not accept 8.00 as denominator, only accepts 8
	- hint for summary wants '0.12' but correct answer is '12' cents ...

problem 8
	*- problem text 'passersby' instead of 'passerby' and 'who were polled' instead of 'who polled'
	
problem 9

problem 13
	*- combobox option should say 'minutes of the movie Emily has already watched'

problem 14
	*- problem text review 'observed 2400 instances'
	*- combobox options 'number of yawns that induced secondary yawns', 'number of independent yawns', 'total number of yawns observed'
	*- summary text '2022 yawns is 84.25% out of 2400 total yawns.'

problem 15
