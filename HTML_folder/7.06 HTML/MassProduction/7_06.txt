%(ybug)%	If you walk 3 miles every hour.	You count 6 cars every minute.	The chickens lay 150 eggs in one day.	The length of the tree increases with 1.8 feet every one year.	"You started off with 21 dollars, and each day you add another $6."	Your bill is always $20 and grows with $0.10 with every minute you call.	Every return ticket costs $550.	The cyclists ride at a pace of 21 miles an hour.	You will always have to pay $2.50 and $1.50 added to that for every mile you sit in the taxi.	The 60 'backup snacks' are always needed. Add 15 snacks TIMES the number of guests.
%(q1_table_hint)%	"If you walk 3 miles in one hour, that means in TWO hours you will walk 2 * 3 miles."	"You count 6 cars every minute, so after one minute of counting you have counted how many cars?"	The chickens lay 150 eggs in one day. That means in TWO days they lay how many eggs?	The length of the tree increases with 1.8 feet every one year. So in 10 years the tree has grown 10 * 1.8 feet.	"You started off with 21 dollars, and now you've added another $6. How many dollars do you have now?"	"With no minutes used, you still have to pay the $20."	"If one return ticket costs $550, three round-trip tickets cost 3 * $550."	The cyclists ride at a pace of 21 miles an hour. That means in one hour they will have travelled how many miles?	"With just one mile, you pay $2.50 plus 1 * $1.50"	For 10 guests you will need 10 * 15 = 150 snacks. Add this to the 60 'backup snacks'.
%(q2_table_hint)%	"If you walk 3 miles in one hour, that means in THREE hours you will walk 3 * 3 miles."	You count 6 cars every minute. That means after exactly 5 minutes you've counted 5 * 6 cars.	The chickens lay 150 eggs in one day. That means in TEN days they lay 10 x 150 eggs.	The length of the tree increases with 1.8 feet every one year. So in 30 years the tree has grown 30 * 1.8 feet.	In four weeks you will have your initial $21 PLUS 4 * $6 more.	100 minutes of 10 cents each equals a total of $10 added to the $20 you start with.	"If one return ticket costs $550, three round-trip tickets cost 5 * $550."	The cyclists ride at a pace of 21 miles an hour. That means in five hours they will have travelled 5 * 21 miles.	"For an 8-mile cab ride, you pay 8 * $1.50 = $12 plus the initial $2.50."	For 42 guests you will need 42 * 15 = 630 snacks. Add this to the 60 'backup snacks'.
%(q3_table_hint)%	"If you walk 3 miles in one hour, that means in FOUR hours you will walk 4 * 3 miles."	You count 6 cars every minute. That means after half an hour (30 minutes) you've counted 30 * 6 cars.	The chickens lay 150 eggs in one day. That means in SEVEN days they lay 7 x 150 eggs.	The length of the tree increases with 1.8 feet every one year. So in 100 years the tree has grown 100 * 1.8 feet.	In ten weeks you will have your initial $21 PLUS 10 * $6 more.	500 minutes of 10 cents each equals a total of $50 added to the $20 you start with.	"If one return ticket costs $550, three round-trip tickets cost 14 * $550."	The cyclists ride 8 hours a dat at a pace of 21 miles an hour. That means in one day they will have travelled 8 * 21 miles.	"For an 18-mile cab ride, you pay 18 * $1.50 = $27 plus the initial $2.50."	For 210 guests you will need 210 * 15 = 3150 snacks. Add this to the 60 'backup snacks'.
