%(problem_statement)%	You standing in line to get some frozen yogurt. There are a lot of people lining up.	The world's fastest elevator is in the Taipei 101 building in Taiwan.	Barry is paying off a loan from a bank he got to buy a car.	You are allowed to send a limited number of text messages each month.	"Jim owns a factory that makes clothes. He wants to built another one, and he needs machines and human workers to operate it."	It is fall and the trees in Pittsburgh begin to shed their leafs.	On a school fair you are handing out free fruit.	"An American spy just found a hidden elevator on the top of a mountain, on a secret island. He decides this could be the secret base he is looking for. Taking the elevator down he looks at his height meter app:"	"Since e-mail and text messaging are increasingly popular, less normal mail is sent every year. "
%(problem_info)%	You count that there are 42 people in front of you. The cashier helps 6 customers every minute.	It goes 2 floors per second and Vincent is riding it going down from the 101st floor.	"Every month he pays off $300 of the $10,200 he owes."	Your current plan allows for 800 texts each month. You send 20 messages each day.	A factory needs 900 people to make clothes if it has no machines. Each machine Jim buys replaces twelve workers.	A particular oak has 3000 leafs left today and loses 120 every day.	You have 200 pieces of fruit and hand out four pieces to anybody that comes by.	it says he's at 1200 ft above sea level and goes down 25 ft every second.	"In 2006, there were 43.6 billion letters sent in the US. This number decreases by 2.5 billion every year."

%(ybug)%	"Of the 42 people lining up, six leave every minute."	The elevator goes DOWN two floors every second.	"Barry debt of $10,200 decreases with $300 every month."	You start out with 800 messages and use (remove) 20 every day.	A factory without machines needs 900 workers. For each machine you may subtract 12 workers.	Today the oak has 3000 leafs. Each day it loses 120 of those leafs.	You start with 200 pieces of fruit and give away four to every person.	The spy is at an elvation of 1200 feet and drops 25 feet every second.	You start with 43.6 billion letters in 2006 (time is 0). Subtract 2.5 for each year later than 2006 and add 2.5 for each year earlier than 2006.
%(q1_table_hint)%	"Every minute, the line gets shorter by 6 people. This means after one minute there are 6 less people. Subtract this number from 42."	"The elevator goes DOWN two floors every second. This means to find the floor after one second, you have to subtract 2 from 101."	"If Barry pays off $300 every month, he'll have $10,200 - (3 * $300) debt left after three months."	"You use up 20 messages every day. So after four days, at total of 4*20=80 messages have been used. Subtract this number from 800."	If there are 0 machines Jim needs 900 workers. If there are 2 machines Jim needs 2 * 12 = 24 workers less.	Read the introduction to find out how many leafs the oak has right now.	"If you give 10 people fruit, you have lost 4 * 10 = 40 pieces. Subtract this from the 200 pieces of fruit."	25 feet every second is 16 * 25 = 400 feet after 16 seconds Subtract this from 1200 feet.	You will need to subtract 2.5 (billion) from 43.6 (billion) for each year. So after one year there are 43.6 - 2.5 = ... billion letters sent.
%(q2_table_hint)%	"Every minute, the line gets shorter by 6 people. This means after two minutes there are 12 less people. Subtract this number from 42."	"The elevator goes DOWN two floors every second. This means to find the floor after four seconds, you have to subtract 2 * 4 from 101."	"If Barry pays off $300 every month, he'll have $10,200 - (8 * $300) debt left after eight months."	"You use up 20 messages every day. So after fourteen days, at total of 14*20=280 messages have been used. Subtract this number from 800."	If there are 0 machines Jim needs 900 workers. If there are 10 machines Jim needs 10 * 12 = 120 workers less.	In two weeks time the oak will lose 120 * 14 = 1680 leafs. Subtract this from 3000.	"If you give 20 people fruit, you have lost 4 * 20 = 80 pieces. Subtract this from the 200 pieces of fruit."	25 feet every second is 33 * 25 = 825 feet after 33 seconds Subtract this from 1200 feet.	You will need to subtract 2.5 (billion) from 43.6 (billion) for each year. So in 9 years there will be 43.6 - (9 * 2.5) = 43.6 - 22.5 billion letters sent.
%(q3_table_hint)%	"Every minute, the line gets shorter by 6 people. This means after four minutes there are 24 less people. Subtract this number from 42."	"The elevator goes DOWN two floors every second. This means to find the floor after twelve seconds, you have to subtract 2 * 12 from 101."	"If Barry pays off $300 every month, he'll have $10,200 - (12 * $300) debt left after one year."	"You use up 20 messages every day. So after 31 days, at total of 31*20=620 messages have been used. Subtract this number from 800."	If there are 0 machines Jim needs 900 workers. If there are 25 machines Jim needs 25 * 12 = 300 workers less.	In two days the oak loses 240 leaves. Add this number to 3000 to find how many leafs it had two days ago.	"If you give 40 people fruit, you have lost 4 * 40 = 160 pieces. Subtract this from the 200 pieces of fruit."	25 feet every second is 60 * 25 = 1500 feet after one minute. Subtract this from 1200 feet.	You will need to add 2.5 (billion) to 43.6 (billion) for each year earlier than 2006. So 5 years before 2001 there were 43.6 + (5 * 2.5) = 43.6 + 12.5 billion letters sent.
